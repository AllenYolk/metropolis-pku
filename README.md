# metropolis-pku

A delicate beamer theme for PKU students, modified from [Metropolis](https://github.com/matze/mtheme).

Thanks [良亦无言](https://www.zhihu.com/people/espero1999) for the original beamer demo!

## Customization

Feel free to change the color theme by modifying the following line in `demo.tex`.

```latex
\usepackage{styles/colorthemes/pku} % a .sty file in ./styles/colorthemes/
```

Also, you may want to change the styles and contents of the head line and foot line. Just modify the code in `./styles/headline.sty` and `./styles/footline.sty`.
